# IT-Support with Merit America x Coursera x Google

In this IT Support program with Merit America, I gained skills in technical support. I gained a solid foundation in the field through mock troubleshooting scenarios, spiceworks tutorials and more. All this was in partnership with Coursera from which I ultimately earned a Google IT Support Professional certification.
